Refunds are processed manually via your Stripe Dashboard. The plugin sends cancellation emails automatically when a booking is cancelled.

== External Services ==

This plugin connects to the following external services:

**Stripe** — payment processing
This plugin uses the Stripe API to create payment intents and process card payments. When a customer makes a booking, their payment details are submitted directly to Stripe's servers. Your Stripe secret key is used server-side to create payment intents. Stripe's privacy policy: https://stripe.com/privacy — Stripe's terms of service: https://stripe.com/terms

**Stripe.js** — Stripe's JavaScript library (https://js.stripe.com/v3/) is loaded on booking pages to securely collect card details. Card data never touches your server.

**Escape Room Booking Pro licence server** — upgrade prompts only
The free version contains links to https://escaperoombookingpro.com for upgrade information. No data is sent to this server from the free version.
